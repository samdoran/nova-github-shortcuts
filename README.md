GitHub Shortcuts provides quick shortcuts to open or share links to your code hosted on GitHub.

## Requirements

GitHub shortcuts requires access to the `git` command-line tool. You very likely already have it!

## Usage

You'll find a "GitHub Shortcuts" item in the editor context menu, or can use the Command Palette and search for GitHub. In either, you'll find:

- **Open File**: Opens the current file in your default browser.
- **Open Selection**: Opens the current file, with the selected lines highlighted in your default browser.
- **Copy Link to File**: Copies the link to the current file to the clipboard.
- **Copy Link to Selection**: Copies the link to the current file, with the selected lines highlighted to the clipboard.
